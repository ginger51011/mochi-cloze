A simple and pretty Anki card template.

This version has the following features added by me (Emil):

- Code cleanup
- Support for hiding tags when they are of the subtag `hidden_tag`, so `top::next::hidden_tag` can replace `top::next` to hide it
- Support for custom CSS based on different bottom level tags, for example using different color palettes for different programming languages. Check `rust` tag/CSS class for example.
